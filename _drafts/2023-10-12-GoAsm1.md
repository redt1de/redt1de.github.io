> Note: Go assembly has unique characteristics for different architectures and operating systems. This post is focused on 64-bit Windows systems and Go 1.20.4 so this WILL NOT apply if you are using it in some other configuration. Additionally, the Go ABI has changed since version 1.16 (and could change again) so some of this may not apply if you are using a different version of Go.

# Intro
This is just a quick intro to using Go assembly for malware development. First I would like to say that I am not an expert in Go or assembly, and this is just a collection of notes I have taken while playing with Go based malware. I am sure there are better ways to do some of this, but this is what I have found to work for me. I will try to keep this updated as I learn more, and if you have any suggestions or corrections, please let me know. This post assumes you have basic Go, Intel assembly knowledge and minimal experience with x64dbg. Part 1 will cover some of the basics of Go assembly and some tricks I use to make life easier. In part 2 we will hopefully do something a bit more interesting, maybe direct/indirect syscalls or something simple but fun.



# Setup
To get started you will need a go development environment and a Windows system with x64dbg to test on. I'm building on Linux with  go 1.20.4 and using a Windows 10 x64 VM. 

### Create a new Go project with the following files...
```go
package main

import "fmt"

// must define asm funcs in the package. similar to extern in C
func asmfunc(argh ...uintptr) uint32

func main() {
	ret := asmfunc(0x1, 0x2, 0x3)
	fmt.Printf("asmfunc returned: %d\n", ret)
}
```
{: file='project/main.go'}

```
#include "textflag.h"

// func asmfunc(argh ...uintptr) uint32
TEXT ·asmfunc(SB), $0-16     // (variadic arg base(8) + variadic arg len(8)) = 16
    MOVQ AX,AX                       // this does nothing, just here so we can search for the start of our ASM since x64dbg doesn'g handle go symbols
    XORQ R15,R15
    RET
```
{: file='project/windows_amd64.s'}

**Compile Command (if cross-compiling)**
```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -a -o ./project.exe .
```

## Debugger Pains
 x64dbg does not handle Go symbols, so debugging can be a pain. To make things easier, we will add a "tag" and set a breakpoint on it to find the start of our assembly function. The tag can be any unique assembly operation, one not likely to be used in real code. I typically use something like `MOVQ AX,AX` since it does nothing and is not likely to found in code.

**x64dbg command to set a breakpoint on the start of our function**

`findasm "mov rax,rax";bp ref.addr(0)`

> You can run this in the x64dbg command prompt, however you will need to execute it with each reload. A better approach is to add this to your system breakpoint scripts via Options > System Breakpoint Scripts, then click create/open for either "every process" or for the current project.
{: .prompt-tip }



**Test**

Test the setup by building the project and opening the exe in x64dbg.  Once the breakpoint is set using the above command, click run and you should hit the breakpoint and see something like the following...

Notice the dissasembly looks very similar to the code in windows_amd64.s


# Golang Assembly Basics
Golang uses its own assembly language, which is based off of the Plan9 assembly language. The syntax is similar to Intel syntax, but there are some differences. One obvious difference is data moves from left to right, so `MOVQ AX,BX` will move AX into BX, and operations like `ADDQ AX,BX` the result will be in BX. In intel assembly operations follow the syntax: `op dst,src` but in go this is `op src,dst`. This is important to remember, when we look at our asm in x64dbg, the registers will be reveresed in the dissasembly view. Another difference is the use of parenthesis instead of square brackets to reference memory addresses.


## Registers
For the most part, all the standard registers are accesbile, but the way they are accessed is very different. In intel assembly `RAX` represents a 64-bit register. To access the various parts of this register you would use the following patterns:
- RAX (64-bit)
- EAX (32-bit)
- AX (16-bit)
- AH (8-bit)
- AL (8-bit)

In Go assembly, the prefixes (R|E) are not used and registers do not specify the size of data being accessed, instead all registers are named as they would be in intel as a 16-bit register `RAX = AX`, `RBX = BX` and so on. Accessing the various parts of a register is handle by the operation itself. Typically this is done by appending Q, L, W, or B (Quadword,Long,Word,Byte) to the opcode to identify 64-bit, 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit operations.  The exception to this is the 8-bit register `AH`, which must be explicitly mentioned in the operation.  The following are some examples of how to access the various parts of the RAX register in Go assembly.
```
MOVQ [64 bit value],AX   // == mov rax, [some 64 bit value]
MOVL [32 bit value],AX   // == mov eax, [some 32 bit value]
MOVW [16 bit value],AX   // == mov ax, [some 16 bit value]
MOVB [8 bit value],AX    // == mov al, [some 8 bit value]
MOVB [8 bit value],AH    // == mov ah, [some 8 bit value]
``` 

### Referencing Addresses
In intel assembly the most common way to reference an address in a register is to use the square brackets around the register `[rax]`. In Go assembly, the square brackets are not used. Instead, the register is surrounded by parenthesis `(AX)`. 

```
MOVQ (AX),BX  // RBX = *RAX
```

<!-- ### Offsets -->
In Intel assembly, you can specify an offset from a register by using the plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) followed by the offset: `mov rbx, [rax+0x10]`

In Go assembly, a const offset is specified before the register and the register is surrounded by parenthesis. The syntax is a bit more confusing when using another register to specify an offset. When referecing another register as the offset, it goes in parenthesis AFTER the register, and must include a scale factor/number of bytes (*scale) i.e. `(AX)(BX*1)` and `10(AX)(BX*1)` but this is essentially just additon without the + `10+(AX)+(BX*1)`. The scale factor can make life eaiser when working with structs or arrays but for simple operations (counters and such) where you are using the value as is, you can use a scale factor of `*1`. When a `$` precedes a memory operation, it means that the address is used, it essentially turns a MOV into an LEA (Load Effective Address) operation.

The following are some examples of referencing addresses in Go assembly.
```
MOVQ (AX),BX            // BX = *AX               | mov rbx,qword ptr ds:[rax]
MOVQ 16(AX), BX         // BX = *(AX + 16)        | mov rbx,qword ptr ds:[rax+10]
MOVQ 0x10(AX), BX       // same but with hex      | mov rbx,qword ptr ds:[rax+10]
MOVQ 16(AX)(CX*1),BX    // BX = *(16 + AX + CX*1) | mov rbx,qword ptr ds:[rax+rcx+10]
MOVQ $16(AX)(CX*1),BX   // BX = &(8 + AX + CX)    | lea rbx,qword ptr ds:[rax+rcx+10]
MOVQ ·blahVar1(SB), BX  // BX = *blahVar1         | mov rbx,qword ptr ds:[blahVar1]
MOVQ $·blahVar1(SB), BX // BX = &blahVar1         | lea rbx,qword ptr ds:[blahVar1]
```

{: .prompt-warning }

> **Bonus Tip:** use `#define` to define offsets to args or struct fields. For example, if I have a struct that looks like the following:
```
type MyStruct struct {
    Field1 uint32   // 4 bytes
    Field2 uint64   // 8 bytes
    Field3 uint32   // 4 bytes
}
```
Then in the assembly I would define the offsets like so:
```
#define Field1 0    // offset of first field is 0
#define Field2 4    // Field1 is 4 bytes, so Field2 starts at offset 4
#define Field3 12    // Field2 is 8 bytes, so Field3 starts at offset 12
```
that way I can reference the fields as more readable code:  `MOVQ Field3(AX),BX` instead of:  `MOVQ 12(AX),BX`. This is also handy if the struct changes since you can adjust the defines and not have to change all of the offests specified in the function

### Pseudo Registers
> TODO: change this to a section about pseudo registers.
- FP = 8(SP)  
- using FP without varname fails: .\windows_amd64.s:8: cannot reference FP without a symbol
- On architectures with a hardware register named SP, the name prefix distinguishes references to the virtual stack pointer from references to the architectural SP register. That is, x-8(SP) and -8(SP) are different memory locations: the first refers to the virtual stack pointer pseudo-register, while the second refers to the hardware's SP register. (A Quick Guide to Go's Assembler)
{: .prompt-warning }

FP is a virtual register used to access the current stack frame. It's used to access the parameters passed to the function, as well as the local variables. One odd note about Go's use of FP, when referencing a parameter using an FP offset, you need to specify a variable name otherwise the compiler will complain. For example, if you have a function that takes a single parameter, you would access it like so: `MOVQ someVar+0(FP),AX`

## Function Declaration
```
TEXT ·funcName(SB),FRAME_OPTIONS, $FRAME_SIZE-ARG_SIZE
```
* **TEXT** - specifies that this is code, meant for the .text section of the binary
* **·funcName(SB)** - the name of the function, notice the mid-dot (·) instead of a period (annoying). Although this looks like a normal func(param) style syntax, it is not. SB = static base (base address of the process). So think of this as an offset(REG) style syntax.
* **FRAME_OPTIONS** - here you define some options to direct the compiler. Some common ones are `NOSPLIT` - dont include the stack check prologue, and `NOFRAME` - Do not insert instructions to allocate a stack frame and save/restore the return addres
* **FRAME_SIZE** - the size of the frame, a 0 indicates that we do not want to reserve any stack space, I choose to manually do this if needed. A value here will cause the compiler to insert sub/add rsp operations to allocate/deallocate stack space.
* **ARG_SIZE** - the size of the arguments passed to the function, which live on the callers frame. Note the (**-**) before this is not subtraction, its just go syntax to seperate the two values (optional)

## Push/Pop Probs
Another annoying issue when writing in Go asm, is using PUSH/POP to mess with the stack. The compiler checks to make sure that these operations are balnaced to avoid stack problems, and if your PUSH/POP operations do not match up, you will get the following compiler error: `asm: "".asmfunc: unbalanced PUSH/POP`. This is great for code safety, but not so great for manually messing with the stack. To get around this, there are a couple options. First, the compiler doesnt do much other than check that there are an equal number of push/pop operations. so you can do something like the following:
```
    PUSHQ AX
    PUSHQ AX
    PUSHQ AX

    JMP skippops
    POPQ AX
    POPQ AX
    POPQ AX
skippops:
    RET
```
This just jumps over POP operations so the compiler doesnt complain, but this adds to clutter in the code. Another option is to manually PUSH and POP. These operations are essentially just 2 operations. add or remove from the stack pointer, and move the value from the register to the stack or vice versa. So you can do something like the following:
```
#define _PUSH(val) \
    SUBQ $8,SP     \
    MOVQ val,0(SP)

#define _POP(r)	 \
    MOVQ 0(SP),r \
    ADDQ $8,SP
```
here we are defining macros that mimic PUSH and POP.  They can be used like so: `_PUSH(AX)` and `_POP(AX)`, just keep in mind that in your dissasembly you will see add/sub and mov in place of where you expect to see PUSH/POP.

## Missing Operations
The majority of the operations needed have some go version, however in the event you need to use an operation that is not supported, you can insert raw bytes, and they will be processed as the equivelent operations, essentially shellcode. So for example, a NOP is 0x90 hex.  So you can do something like the following: `#define _NOP BYTE $0x90` and then use `_NOP` in your code. This can also be expanded to more complex operations or even entire functions written in the hex equivilent of the intel assembly.

## Misc Notes
 - other architecture/operating systems use architecture-specific details, this post is focused on x64 Windows systems so some of this will not apply if you are targeting a different architecture/operating system.
 - when building a dll or anything that uses cgo, the compiler can be funky with asm. if you get errors, move the asm file and function declaration to an internal package.

# Calling Conventions 
A calling convention is a low-level scheme for how subroutines receive parameters from their caller and how they return a result. For example most WINAPI calls use the stdcall calling convention. 

## Windows Calling Convention
STDCALL basics: (From: [Windows x64 Calling Convention: Stack Frame](https://www.ired.team/miscellaneous-reversing-forensics/windows-kernel-internals/windows-x64-calling-convention-stack-frame))
* First four integer arguments are passed to RCX, RDX, R8 and R9 registers accordingly (green)
* Arguments 5, 6, and further are pushed on to the stack (blue)
* Return address to the caller's next instruction is pushed is found at RSP + 0x0 (yellow)
* Below return address (RSP + 0x0) 32 bytes are always allocated for RCD, RDX, R8 and R9, even if the callee  uses less than 4 arguments
* Local variables and non-volatile registers are stored above the return address (red)

![stdcall](https://2603957456-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-LFEMnER3fywgFHoroYn%2F-MCIa9pSPy_0kCY1QurB%2F-MCmJ-mF3kZ4qAsLpCRF%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=83e4b8d8-4bdb-43e6-a423-5e317cd10776)


## Go Calling Convention
If you have done any reading about the Go calling convention, you would know that older versions of go use a stack based convention known as `ABI0`. This means that all arguments are passed on the stack.  Go 1.16 introduced changes to the calling convention to allow the use of registers to pass arguments, known as `ABIInternal`. The new approach uses an algorithm to determine how arguments should be passed. This is typically either entirely on the stack or entirely in registers depending on the type and number of arguments. When registers are used, a functions arguments are passed from left to right in the registers AX, BX, CX, DI, SI, R8, R9, R10, R11. This sequence is also used for return values. At the time of testing, go assembly functions appear to default to ABI0, although I have seen talk of adding options to specify which is used. Most of this is transparent to us, and for now we can assume ABI0 is in use for our assembly and our args will be on the stack.

To demonstrate the difference and how the runtime chooses for us, we can build the following code and use go's objdump tool to see the assembly that was generated:
```go
package main

func asmfunc(a, b uintptr)

// Note the following line. This is a go compiler directive that tells the compiler not
// to inline this function. Without this line, go will try to build this function into
// the caller, and we will not be able to see what it does in assembly

//go:noinline
func gofunc(a, b uintptr) (uintptr, uintptr) {
	return a + 1, b + 1
}

func main() {
	asmfunc(gofunc(0xaa, 0xbb))
}
```
{: file='project/main.go'}

if we build this and run the following command, we can see what go generates as the assembly:

`go tool objdump -s 'asmfunc|gofunc|main.main' ./project.exe|grep -v 'INT $0x3'`

```plaintext
TEXT main.main(SB):
    CMPQ SP, 0x10(R14)
    JBE 0x45bba3
    PUSHQ BP             
    MOVQ SP, BP                 // ^^ stack check/prologue ^^
    SUBQ $0x10, SP              // make room for our args
    MOVL $0xaa, AX              // setting up AbiInternal (args in regs), first arg in AX
    MOVL $0xbb, BX              // second arg in BX
    CALL main.gofunc(SB)        // call gofunc using ABIInternal      
    MOVQ AX, 0(SP)              // setting up ABI0 (args on stack), for our asm func. first arg on stack
    MOVQ BX, 0x8(SP)            // second arg on stack
    CALL main.asmfunc.abi0(SB)  // call our asmfunc using ABI0, note the .abi0 suffix
    XORPS X15, X15              // vv cleanup/epilogue vv
    MOVQ runtime.tls_g(SB), R14
    MOVQ GS:0(R14), R14
    MOVQ 0(R14), R14
    ADDQ $0x10, SP
    POPQ BP
    RET                 
    CALL runtime.morestack_noctxt.abi0(SB)
    JMP main.main(SB)

TEXT main.gofunc(SB):
    INCQ AX   // AbiInternal (args in regs), first arg in AX
    INCQ BX   // second arg in BX
    RET       // return values in AX and BX, already where they need to be so just return

TEXT main.asmfunc.abi0(SB):   // note the .abi0, which dictates that args will be on the stack
    MOVQ AX, AX  
    RET           // once we return from our windows call, we will need to fill the return values to accomodate the calling convention go is expecting.
```

Understanding this is important, as we will need to move the incoming arguments from the stack to their appropriate place in the stdcall convention. Additionally we will need know how to move any return values to the appropriate registers before we return to Go code.



### Syscall Stub for ZwAllocateVirtualMemory
